 - No sensitive data is deliberately persisted on the client, but sensitive data is sent over
SSL/TLS connections, and some browsers might locally cache data sent over these
connections;

 - DPAPI is used on the server to protect sensitive connection strings and encryption keys
for non-administrators;

 - The database server holds authentication information;

 - The database server adequately protects authentication data by using database server
authorization technology and, potentially, encryption;

 - IIS 6.0 and ASP.NET enforce authentication correctly;

 - Web service security configuration is held in Web.config files and can be manipulated
only by valid administrators. This rule is enforced through operating system access
control lists (ACLs);

 - The server application setup program correctly configures the ACL for the Web.config
file;

 - Only valid admins administer any server by using Terminal Services or physically
accessing the server when needed;

 - Only valid admins have physical access to the Web and database servers;

 - Browsing the Internet, reading e-mail messages, and using peer-to-peer or instant
messaging applications on the servers is expressly prohibited;

 - Databases are configured to use their native authentication protocols rather than
operating system authentication protocols. For example, SQL Server uses Standard
authentication and not Windows authentication. This is done for two main reasons.
First, most users are Internet-based users, not Windows users. The second reason is
performance—native authentication schemes are faster;

 - The connection information for each database is stored in the application’s Web.config
file and protected by using the Protected Configuration option, which uses DPAPI.
