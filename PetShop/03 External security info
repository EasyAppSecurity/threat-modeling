 - Admins can change any setting in the system, including the Web service;

 - The only ports open are TCP/3389 (for administration accessible only to other administration computers), 
TCP/80 (for HTTP traffic accessible from the Internet), TCP/443
(for HTTPS traffic accessible from the Internet), TCP/1433 and TCP/1521 (for database
access that is accessible only by the Web server and by administration computers), and
TCP/3372 (for MSDTC, which is accessible by all computers involved in order-processing
transactions—these are usually just the Web server computers and database server
computers);
